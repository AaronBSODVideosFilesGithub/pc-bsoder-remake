Based off the I love you virus on notepad that I found on Youtube like 2 years ago
Heres the video that I found:
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UGt-ytdbkDk
while I turned this I love you virus notepad into
a bsod tool

I kinda abandoned my pc-crasher since 2025
but im now reworking it now
im now on this account cuz im obviously locked out of
AaronGithubFiles.

Just note that while your using the tool
Your BSOD may get delayed tho


if the tool seems to not work, try replacing the notmyfaultc contained in the "PCCRASHERLOC" folder with
an old version. For me i used not-my-fault version 4.2.0 
if you want the notmyfault 4.2.0 here it is:
https://archive.org/download/not-my-fault-4.2.0-patched-for-windows-xp
(IF YOU USE WINDOWS THAT NEWER VERSIONS OF NOTMYFAULT WONT WORK ON)
